## Code Description

It is noted to check the *paths* in scripts before running the code; otherwise errors occur. 


### Content
  * `chamfer_pytorch` The third-part dependency for computing Chamfer loss, see below.
  * `human_body_prior` The third-part dependency for VPoser, see below.
  * `data/ade20_to_mp3dlabel.npy` The dictionary to map annotation from ADE20K to Matterport3D.
  * `data/resnet18.pth` The pre-trained ResNet for scene encoding in our work.
  * `frontend_sh_scripts` The bash scripts using the python scripts.
  * `source` The python code of model, data loading, training, testing and fitting.
  * `utils` The python code of evaluation, visualization and others.
  * `demo.ipynb` The script for an interactive demo. See `images/PSI_demo_use.mp4` for how to use it.
  * `checkpoints` Trained models are put here.
  * `body_models` SMPL-X body mesh model, and VPoser. See below.



### Dependencies
Note that different dependency versions may lead to different results from ours.

Install requirements via:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the following packages following their individual instructions:
  1. [Perceiving Systems Mesh Package](https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh)
  2. [Chamfer Pytorch](https://github.com/ThibaultGROUEIX/ChamferDistancePytorch/tree/719b0f1ca5ba370616cb837c03ab88d9a88173ff), which is also included in our repo.
  3. [Human Body Prior](https://github.com/nghorbani/human_body_prior), which is also included in our repo.
  4. [SMPL-X](https://github.com/vchoutas/smplify-x)



### Examples

We provide a `demo.ipynb` file to summarize our methods. To perform systematic experiments, we recommend to use traing, fitting and evaluation scripts in `frontend_sh_scripts`. To visualize the test results, one can check `utils_show_test_results.py`, `utils_show_test_results_habitat.py` and `run_render.sh` for details.

## Datasets

### PROX-E

![](images/proxe.png)

The __PROX-E__ dataset is developed on top of [PROX](https://prox.is.tue.mpg.de/), and one can see the comparison between __PROX__ and __PROX-E__ in our manuscript. When using __PROX-E__, please first download the __PROX__ dataset, and also cite [PROX](https://prox.is.tue.mpg.de/). As an expansion pack of __PROX__, we additionally provide scene meshes with semantic annotation, scene/human body data captured from virutal and real cameras, and other auxilariy files.

__PROX-E__ can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WfhoRv45ch5xb_UFbCAwkavPyHszhCyY/view). After downloading __PROX__ and the __PROXE__ expansion pack, there will be:
  1. `body_segments` The body segments from __PROX__.
  2. `PROXE_box_verts.json` The vertices of virtual walls, fitted ceiling and floors.
  3. `scenes` The scene mesh from __PROX__.
  4. `scenes_downsampled` The downsampled scene mesh.
  5. `scenes_sdf` The signed distance function of scenes. SDF can be dowloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O00Qixblnq03KDcP6RuDvHkgZQ_vK_pA/view?usp=sharing)
  6. `scenes_semantics` The scene mesh with vertex color as object ID. Note: `verts_id=np.asarray(mesh.vertex_colors)*255/5.0`.
  7. `snapshot_for_testing` The snapshot from the real camera of __PROX__ test scenes. Each mat file has the body configurations, scene depth/semantics, and camera pose of each frame. These files ease to load data during testing phase.
  8. `realcams.hdf5` The compact file of real camera snapshots, for which the frame rate is downsampled.
  9. `virtualcams.hdf5` The compact file of virtual camera snapshots. See `batch_gen_hdf5.py` for how to use these h5 files.

Note that the __PROXE__ expansion pack may update as __PROX__ updates.



### MP3D-R

![](images/mp3dr.png)

We trim the room meshes from [Matterport3D](https://github.com/niessner/Matterport) according to the room bounding box annotation, and capture scene depth/semantics using the [Habitat simulator](https://aihabitat.org/). Details are referred to our manuscript. Here we provide the scene names/ids, camera poses, captured depth/segmentation, and SDFs of the used scene meshes. Due to the data use agreement, we encourage users to download __Matterport3D__ and install __Habitat simulator__, and then extract the corresponding scene meshes used in our work.

__MP3D-R__ can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A6ecDjPt7hGBaxFI61QVogWNyGon_FJg/view?usp=sharing). The package has:
  1. `{room_name}-sensor` The captured RGB/Depth/Semantics, as well as the camera poses. NOTE: the camera pose is relative to the *world coordinate of the original Matterport3D building mesh*, while the generated body meshes are relative to the camera coordinate. An additional transformation is necessary. See `utils_show_test_results_habitat.py` for our implementation. 
  2. `sdf` The computed signed distance function of the room meshes.
  3. `*.png` Rendered images of our extracted scene meshes.

## Models

### Body Mesh Models
We use [SMPL-X](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/) to represent human bodies in our work. Besides installing the `smplx` module, users also need to download the smplx model and the VPoser model, as demonstrated in [SMPL-X](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/). It is noticed that different versions of `smplx` and `VPoser` will influece our generation results.


### Our Trained Checkpoints
One can download our trained checkpoints [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w9Sl94ku6L7nwBzdXsApSQO1lOf-yFCB/view?usp=sharing). The used hyper-parameters are included in the filename. For example,
```
checkpoints_proxtrain_modelS1_batch32_epoch30_LR0.0003_LossVposer0.001_LossKL0.1_LossContact0.001_LossCollision0.01
```
means using data in __PROXE__ training scenes, stage-one model, batch size 32, epoch 30, learning rate 0.0003, as well as the specified loss weights.
